# Unity---Tanks-game

Mini-game project realized in one day, featuring tanks.

Controls:
- W, A, S, D to move.
- Hold Left shift while moving to use boost (the tank has a limited amount of boost, but will recharge after some time).
- Left click to fire simple bullets (illimited ammo).
- Right click to fire missiles (ammo limited to 8).
- Moving the mouse will change the direction of the canon/camera, FPS-style.
- Escape to quit the game.

The enemy AI is basic : it will go after the closest enemy (be it the player or another tank).

When the player's hp reach 0, the game restarts automatically.
